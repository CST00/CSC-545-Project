# CSC-545-Project

## About the project

This application was created to help users find cooking ideas. The database will store a number of recipes, complete with their ingredients, recipe, category, nutrition, and more. You can use these recipes to fill out your weekly meal plan. Each day of the week can have a meal assigned for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

Not sure what to eat? Find something you have in your fridge and search for all recipes that contain that ingredient. Or if you're in the mood for a particular kind of meal, you can also search by recipe categories.

Once you've filled out your meal plan for the week, you can simply generate a shopping list that will tell you exactly what ingredients you need to buy at the store!

## How to run
